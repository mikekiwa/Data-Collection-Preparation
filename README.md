# Data-Collection-Preparation
The objective of this project is to collect a dataset from one or more open web APIs of your choice, and use Python to pre-process and analyse the collected data.   1. Choose one or more open web APIs as your source of data. If you decide to use more than one API, the APIs should be related in some way. 2. Collect data from your chosen API(s) using Python. Your dataset should contain at least 100 records/items in total. Depending on the API(s), you may need to repeat the collection process multiple times to download sufficient data. 3. Parse the collected data, and store it in an appropriate file format for subsequent analysis (e.g. plain text, JSON, XML, CSV). 4. Load and represent the data using an appropriate data structure (i.e. records/ items as rows, described by features as columns). Apply any pre-processing steps that might be required to clean/filter/combine the data before analysis. 5. Analyse and summarize the cleaned dataset, using tables and visualizations where appropriate.
